EpicVote is a piece of PHP/HTML that you place on your website. Once on your website within the PHP, you add you voting links so players can click a fancy vote instead of default buttons. This was originally created for [MC-Empires](http://mc-empires.ga), but I uploaded on spigot so other users could use it for their startup servers!
